# Agile Prototyping Reflection
During the Agile Prototyping course, I have learned to have a new approach to design, enabling me to be more creative and think in a more open and abstract way. I gained a deep understanding of how systems and their processes can inspire innovative design solutions for architecture and building systems. This methodology allows for a dynamic and adaptable approach, particularly when designing in uncertain or complex environments. The concept of applying biological insights like growth stages, genetic structures, and system evolution to architecture was an intriguing way to approach the architectural engineering discipline.
The reverse engineering approach we used, particularly with my work on the structure system, also played a big role in expanding my mindset. By starting with the end in mind and breaking down completed designs to understand their essential parts and how they evolved, I was able to approach problems more abstractly. This process helped me to look at buildings as systems that grow in response to various external factors, which in turn gave me a broader perspective on how to design structures that can adapt to changes over time.

Through this course, Iâ€™ve developed a deeper understanding of how biomimetic design and agile processes can push the boundaries of architecture, making it not just a field focused on solving today's problems, but one capable of anticipating and responding to the challenges of tomorrow.

#### How I might apply this in the future
In the future, I plan to apply the Agile Prototyping methodology to create flexible and innovative designs. For example, I can use growth stages to design structural systems that adapt to environmental conditions, such as varying wind loads or seismic activity, by incorporating materials or configurations that respond dynamically to these forces. Biomimetic principles can inspire sustainable solutions, such as lightweight yet strong frameworks modeled on natural structures like bones or shells.
This approach will be particularly valuable for addressing challenges like climate change or designing in uncertain environments. Additionally, the reverse engineering mindset will help me collaborate effectively across disciplines, ensuring that different building systems work together to create adaptable and future-ready solutions.
