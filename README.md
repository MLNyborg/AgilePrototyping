# hi
During the Agile Prototyping course, I have learned to have a new approach to design, enabling me to be more creative and think in a more open and abstract way. I gained a deep understanding of how systems and their processes can inspire innovative design solutions for architecture and building systems. This methodology allows for a dynamic and adaptable approach, particularly when designing in uncertain or complex environments. The concept of applying biological insights like growth stages, genetic structures, and system evolution to architecture was an intriguing way to approach the architectural engineering discipline.
The reverse engineering approach we used, particularly with my work on the structure system, also played a big role in expanding my mindset. By starting with the end in mind and breaking down completed designs to understand their essential parts and how they evolved, I was able to approach problems more abstractly. This process helped me to look at buildings as systems that grow in response to various external factors, which in turn gave me a broader perspective on how to design structures that can adapt to changes over time.


Through this course, Iâ€™ve developed a deeper understanding of how biomimetic design and agile processes can push the boundaries of architecture, making it not just a field focused on solving today's problems, but one capable of anticipating and responding to the challenges of tomorrow.
